# collab-novel-in-24hrs
An author (of literature), wondering if Github might work to write a collaborative novel in 24 hours.

I'm a journalist, performer, illustrator and author.

I want to build a team of other authors and editors to collaborate on writing a novel in 24 hours - from start to print.

My idea is to assign particular individuals to particular tasks: narrative structure, description of settings, dialogue, edits, consistency across the book, editing spellings, illustrations - all that stuff.

I know very little about coding but have run my own website using Textpattern, with some knowledge of HTML and Markup - meaning that I probably feel marginally less freaked out here on GitHub than many other authors might feel.

Anyway, some coding people I know have talked about GitHub in a way that made it seem possible that it could be a place to run this experiment in collaborative writing. 

I want to do this in a way that makes it possible to replicate the exercise with, say, school children. I think it would be sensational to show young people that they can work together on an ambitious project like this, and to show that coding and writing literature are not (necessarily, always) entirely different types of exercise. Also: that the work of their own imagination is good enough to be part of a book.

In the long run, I would like to imagine that this could be an annual event at schools. 

This is the first thing I have ever done on GitHub, so I daresay I'm making all kinds of blunders.

Please be kind!

And please tell me if this idea is a non-starter.
